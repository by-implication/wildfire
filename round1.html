			<p>Wildfire is a game about saving the world. Opponents like rampant poverty,
				gender inequality, inadequate education and environmental degradation
				cannot be defeated by marching armies, secret potions or magic swords.
				This is a game about how they can be defeated.</p>

			<p>Through volunteerism, social interaction, and nonviolent activism,
				players will explore a sprawling urban landscape, building up grassroots
				support and seeking legislation on key Millennium Development Goals.
				Standing in their way are the menacing “agents,” representing the various
				forces opposing positive societal change.</p>

			<p>Wildfire’s ultimate goal is not only to offer a challenging, immersive
				gameplay experience, but also to promote universal awareness of the UN
				MDG’s, and how they can be achieved through concrete action.</p>
